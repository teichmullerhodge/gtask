## 🧩 Overview

This is a **task application** made using **GTK4**, featuring a responsive UI built entirely with native widgets (no Glade or XML).  
All task data is stored locally in plain-text files under the user's `$HOME` directory for portability and simplicity.

This is a side project done primarily for fun. If at any point it stops being fun, it will be discontinued. Any collaboration is welcome.
